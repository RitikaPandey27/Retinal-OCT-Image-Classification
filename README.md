# Retinal-OCT-Image-Classification
A deep learning-based system for classifying retinal OCT images into four categories (Normal, CNV, DME, Drusen). Uses ResNet-50 and a custom CNN for automated diagnosis. Achieves 99.34% accuracy with ResNet-50. Future work includes hyperparameter tuning and scalability.
